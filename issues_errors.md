- Need to create backup script for rolling back everything
- Need to work on /etc/yp.conf this contains ypservers which is not there in the excel
- Unix SA need to add this in the sheet
- fine tune NFS share autofind with Filesystem name --< very important
- if there is no data in some tabs need to check how the script behaves
- if usergroup alone need to be executed then it should be independent on other configs
- if we execute the Config bot from second time it should not again repeat the configuration if the config exists
- "boot|root|tmp|swap|snap|udev|sda" this for ubuntu alone but for environment its just "root|swap|tmpfs|boot|<migration NFS>"
- "sda" should be added to egrep by default
